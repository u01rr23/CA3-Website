# Base styling

Colour Scheme - I chose a blue colour scheme as it fits in with the seaside theme of the town's motto. I used different tones of the colour for both the links and the background, keeping it a uniform design. This shade of blue is also accessible to most types of colour blindness, so ensures most users are getting the same visual impact. For contrast, I gave every image a white solid border to draw the user's attention and emphasise the pictures. The background is a lighter tone of blue (#8AB3FF), I chose this colour so that black text would still be able to be read.

Banner - I decided to go for a simple design for my banner as to not draw any attention away from the information being shared on the website. I center aligned the white text to contrast with the left-aligned navigation bar below. I also added in a 1px line in the background colour (#8AB3FF) to divide the navigation bar from  the banner.

Navigation Bar - The navigation bar shares colour with the banner (#0038A0), footer and header texts and therefore looks cohesive with the overall design. To make the text easier to read, I made it white. I chose a brighter, more saturated colour of blue (#004DDB) for when the page is active, and felt this provided enough contrast for the user to easily identify which page they are currently looking at. 

Header text - The header text is dark blue (#0038A0), underlined and is aligned centrally over every page. I chose to keep this uniform from page to page to provide unity in my designs.

Footer - My footer is in dark blue (#0038A0) and draws the reader's attention down the page. It also provides the reader with a clear end-point to the page.

# Index page

Layout - I utilised Bootstrap features to make my layout on this page responsive to different browser sizes. As this page was intended as an introduction to the website and its content, I kept it very simple. 

Text - My text is centre-aligned to contrast with and draw attention to the left-aligned navigation bar. My list of links below is also centre aligned to provide unity with the text above. 

Image - My image is centre-aligned and has a solid 5px white border to make it stand out from the background of the page. It is also rounded to contrast from the banner, navigation bar and footer's harsher rectangular look.
