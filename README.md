# Base styling

Colour Scheme - I chose a blue colour scheme as it fits in with the seaside theme of the town's motto. I used different tones of the colour for both the links and the background, keeping it a uniform design. This shade of blue is also accessible to most types of colour blindness, so ensures most users are getting the same visual impact. For contrast, I gave every image a white solid border to draw the user's attention and emphasise the pictures. The background is a lighter tone of blue (#8AB3FF), I chose this colour so that black text would still be able to be read.

Banner - I decided to go for a simple design for my banner as to not draw any attention away from the information being shared on the website. I center aligned the white text to contrast with the left-aligned navigation bar below. I also added in a 1px line in the background colour (#8AB3FF) to divide the navigation bar from  the banner.

Navigation Bar - The navigation bar shares colour with the banner (#0038A0), footer and header texts and therefore looks cohesive with the overall design. To make the text easier to read, I made it white. I chose a brighter, more saturated colour of blue (#004DDB) for when the page is active, and felt this provided enough contrast for the user to easily identify which page they are currently looking at. 

Header text - The header text is dark blue (#0038A0), underlined and is aligned centrally over every page. I chose to keep this uniform from page to page to provide unity in my designs.

Footer - My footer is in dark blue (#0038A0) and draws the reader's attention down the page. It also provides the reader with a clear end-point to the page.

# Index page

Layout - I utilised Bootstrap features to make my layout on this page responsive to different browser sizes. As this page was intended as an introduction to the website and its content, I kept it very simple. 

Text - My text is centre-aligned to contrast with and draw attention to the left-aligned navigation bar. My list of links below is also centre aligned to provide unity with the text above. 

Images - My image is centre-aligned and has a solid 5px white border to make it stand out from the background of the page. It is also rounded to contrast from the banner, navigation bar and footer's harsher rectangular look.

# Home page

Layout - I have used Bootstrap grid classes to achieve a responsive layout for this page. I used a full-width column for the image. I also used an equally spaced column for the paragraph of text and the static map. I encountered issues with scaling the map to the correct size, but found that setting the width and height to percentages made it suit all displays.

Text - The text is centre aligned and is aligned to be in the vertical centre of the image next to it using flexbox functions.

Images - My image is centre aligned and has a 5px solid white border. I also added the same border to the static map to make it fit in within the design.

# History

Layout - For this page I formatted it as an unorganised list. I felt this was the best way to display a timeline in a visually appealing way. I also chose to put two similar images at the beginning and end of the timeline to indicate a change in time.

Text - The dates on the timeline are emphasised using strong HTML tags and have a blue colour to help them stand out from the rest of the text. The captions for the images are centre aligned below each image.

Images - I chose two images taken from the same place in two different decades. This emphasises the subject of the page as it displays the history of my hometown.

# Visit

Layout - Using the 7:5 column ratio asked in the brief, I created an alternating pattern of text and image down the page using Bootstrap grid. This allows the page to suitable for any browser size. 

Text - The paragraphs of text are centre aligned and are aligned vertically with the images adjacent to them. There is also a hyperlink at the end of each paragraph, allowing the user to access more information about the experiences described.

Image - My image is centre-aligned and has a solid 5px white border to make it stand out from the background of the page. It is also rounded to contrast from the banner, navigation bar and footer's harsher rectangular look.
